# Encode an Uploaded file

Once your file is uploaded you can select the *Working* menu item in order to follow its process.

![Working]({{ "/img/working.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Clicking to a working item will show it full workflow steps from encoding to packaging.

![Workflow]({{ "/img/workflow.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

- **Green items** will be completed tasks.
- **Yellow items** will be working tasks.
- **Blank items** will be yet to be started tasks.
- **Red items** will be tasks failed several times and not schedule to be retried.

For **Failed items** you can look at the reason for failure and in case you can solve the issue, for instance there was 
no more space on disk, you can use the button to restart the task.
